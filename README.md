Plutus Pioneer Program notes and Homework Solutions

## Cohort 3

I am doing the 3rd Cohort of the Plutus Pioneers Program to learn about smart contract development on Cardano

This repo will have all of my work / notes / homework solutions for this program

I will also be including YouTube Videos for this course which you can check out on my Stoic Pool Youtube Channel

### Week 1

Week 1 was mostly about setting up a local environment for the Plutus Playground

The video I made was to show how to do this in a Virtual Machine with Visual Studio Code

### Week 2

Week 2 is all about Validator Scripts

We look at Typed and Untyped Validators

The Hoemwork is simply completeing the Validator part of the Plutus Script to get it to function correctly

I have taken notes about the Validaotr Script lectures and included both Homework assignments in the repo
